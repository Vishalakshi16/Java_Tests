1.MAX MIN NUMBER or SMALL AND LARGEST NUMBER

public class TestQuestion {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a[]= {45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454};
		int temp;
		for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
			for (int j = i+1; j < a.length; j++) {
				if(a[i]>a[j]) {
					temp=a[i];
					a[i]=a[j];
					a[j]=temp;
				}
			}
		
		}
		System.out.println("max num"+" "+a[a.length-1]);
		System.out.println("min num"+" "+a[0]);
	}

2  EVEN AND ODD 

public class TestQuestion1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int petalNum;
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int petalNumber=sc.nextInt();
		
		
			if(petalNumber %2==0) {

6.Difference between linkedList and ArrayList in java

ArrayList:internally call array
          arrayList contain listIterator
          reading operation is easy
          Writting Operation is difficult

linkedList:internally call node
           linkedList dose not contain listIterator
           reading operation is difficult
           Writting Operation is easy

3. What are the Specialization and generalization
generalization:these are refered as superclass
               subclasses can aqured a properties by superclasses inplicitely

Specialization :these are refered as subclass
                subclasses can aqured a properties by superclasses explicitely

5.which sorted collection have you used 
This comes very late, but there is a class in the JDK just for the purpose of having a sorted list. 
It is named (somewhat out of order with the other Sorted* interfaces) "java.util.PriorityQueue". 
It can sort either Comparable<?>s or using a Comparator.

7.Difference between Iterator and ListIterator
Iterator: it is used to access the element forward direction
          it is avilable in collection

ListIterator:it is used to access the element both in forward and backward direction 
             it is special type avilable in listIterator

4.
a)i make my super class methods as private ,this class and methods should not be inherite by other class
b)The final class is a class that is declared with the final keyword. 
  Subclasses can't inherit a final class or a final class cannot be inherited by any subclass.
  So, we can restrict class inheritance by making use of a final class

10.STATIC AND DYNAMIC POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA
static polymorphism refered as compiletime polymorphism 
                    achieved by methode Overloading 
                    method Overloading means declaration of method more than once with a same within a same class but differe in parameterlist


DYNAMIC polymorphism refered as runtime polymorphism 
                    achieved by methode Overloading 
                    method Overriding means method signature must be same  but differe in implementation

11.Hema perform encapsulation by this she can achieve .
 Hema make a class PersonalInformation variable or properties  as private by this way she give security .private variables cannot be use directly .
if other person cannot be able to access
